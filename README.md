# frontend
In this project, I did a sample homepage of typical web. It consists of different sections in typical web page: menu, table, input form, header, mainarea,
sidearea, slideshow as well as animations. It also benefits from two java scripts applications named: cycle2 for slideshow, declarativeToggle for responsive design. 
It is responsive to the screen width of the device !

In order to visualize the project, download the whole files and folders and put it in single folder.
Next open the layout by your browser like google chrome, mozilla firefox.

You can decrease the size of the opened browser to check responsive visualization of the webpage! Or you can use toggle device toolbar of 
developer tool in google chrome!
